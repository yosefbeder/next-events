## Next Events

This is my first project with Next.js and tailwind css!

In this project I tried to practice as many Next.js concepts as I can.

I used 
- Static Site Generation (SSG) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for each event, home, and all events pages.
- Server Side Rendering (SSR) for filtering events by date.
- API Routes for creating a restful api for the backend and the newsletter list.
- Client Side Data Fetching with `useSWR` to render comments and revalidate them every second.

Inspired from [Next.js & React - The Complete Guide (incl. Two Paths!) ](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).
